# RoadSafety
This project attempts to classify the severity of injury (None, Minimal/Minor, Major, or Fatal) using data from all traffic 
collisions events where a person was either Killed or Seriously Injured (KSI) from 2006 â€“ 2020. RandomForest Classification was 
chosen for the model. 

The Dataset was last updated on May 1, 2021 
Dataset can be downloaded from the Toronto Police Services Website for Total Killed or Seriously Injured (KSI) Collisions
